# D360-ChatBot


#PROBLEM STATEMENT 

We have create a conversational AI model using Google Dialogflow that can understand natural language queries for diamonds and generate filtering parameters for a large inventory of diamond data.

#INTRODUCTION

Once the model understands the query, it will generate filtering parameters that can be used to search the diamond inventory and return matching results. The filtering parameters can include a combination of various attributes such as shape, size, weight, clarity, color, and cut, and should be optimized for accuracy and efficiency. 

#OUR APPROACH
1. We have used Dialogflow to create the chatbot for solving the queries entered by the user.
2. Here we have created intent for extracting features and training out model.
3. We have made the use of 'REGEX' for manipulation of the queries by creating entities.
4. Then we have train our model by training test cases by adding into training phrases.
5. Then we have test our model by testing phrases generated by us.
